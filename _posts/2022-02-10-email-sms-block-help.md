Email SMS Block App for iOS will block any SMS message that originates from an
email address. However, it will not block messages from email addresses that are
associated to people in your contact list.

If you are still seeing SMS messages from email address that aren't on your
contact list, please check the following:
 1. Check that Email SMS Block is enabled for SMS Filtering in the Messages
    settings
 2. Open the Email SMS Block app and check that the "Block texts from emails" is
    enabled
