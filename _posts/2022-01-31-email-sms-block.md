It is possible to send a text message to a mobile device by using an email address. This
is commonly known as "Email to SMS". Every mobile phone number has a corresponding email
address that allows this to function. However, it is becoming increasingly rare for most
people to actually need this functionality.

As a result, I created a new app for iOS called Email SMS Blocker that can automatically
mark text messages that originate from email addresses as junk.

Future updates to this app will allow more customization, such as only blocking specific
email address, or allowing specific email addresses through the filter.
