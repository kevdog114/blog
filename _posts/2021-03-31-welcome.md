First things first: Welcome to my blog!

Sorry, didn't know how else to start this thing.

Anyway, I'll be adding content to this blog in the near future in an effort to help me
better organize my thoughts and keep track of important thoughts/details that I may find
useful to my future-self.

I plan to cover a wide range of topics, but to get the creative juices flowing, here are a few topics:

1. Home automation
  a. Useful automations I've created (lighting, smart monitoring, productivity enhancements, etc...)
  b. Ideas for more automations
  c. Ideas for smart home products for myself
2. Siri Shortcuts
  a. Because these are kind of a pain to "write", and might be useful to others?
3. Personal Finance
  a. How I keep track of budgeting, and how I'm integrating it into my smart home system
4. Home server


Oh, and a few housekeeping things - I hate websites that are so complicated (and resource heavy) that my new flagship
smartphone has a hard time rendering. I absolutely hate websites that like to show a slideshow of the "10 Whatever" list
but put an ad in between each slide, and have no less than 50 ads cluttering up the rest of the page.

Therefore, I commit to you that beyond maybe an ad to keep the lights on, this site will remain clean.
